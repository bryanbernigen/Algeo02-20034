## General Information
- The goal of this project is to implement a web that compress and image with SVD method. 
- the SVD were calculated without any help from libraries that could calculate eigenvalues/ eigenvectors/ svd directly. 
- Students were asked to implement what thay got in class by making their own code to calculate eigenvaluses, eigenvectors, and svd.


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.9.2
- Flask 2.0.2
- numpy 1.21.4
- OpenCV 2.3. 1
